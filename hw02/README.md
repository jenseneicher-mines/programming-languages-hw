# CSCI-400 Homework 02

Instructions
============

- Pull the updated starter code repository into your (local) user
  repository.

- Implement the functions marked with `// TODO` comments:
  - In the file `PatternMatching.scala`, implement pre-order and
    post-order traversal of a tree (returning the new list).
  - In the file `Sum.scala`, implement recursive function `sum(n)`
    which produces the result `2 + 4 + 8 + ...` for the first *n*
    powers of 2 (where *n* is a non-negative integer). Do not use
    Scala's built-in power function.

- Implement test cases for your code:
  - In the file `PatternMatchingTests.scala`, add at least 5 test
    cases for each of your functions in `PatternMatchingTests.scala`
    (all tests should pass when you run `sbt test`)
  - In the file `SumTest.scala`, add at least 3 tests cases for your
    `sum` function (all tests should pass when you run `sbt test`)


Submission
==========

These submission instructions are intended to make submitting your
code easy and avoid errors with incorrect submissions.  Please take
care to correctly submit your work by the deadline.

- Push all changes to your user repo (which you created for HW 01) in
  the course organization before the deadline.

- The TA/instructor will clone the user repos (based on the repository
  name prefix) at the deadline and grade the code in the master
  branch.

- ONLY CODE THAT IS CORRECTLY SUBMITTED BY THE DEADLINE WILL BE
  GRADED:
  - Ensure that your code is pushed to a correctly named repo in the
    course organization.  Incorrectly named repos will not be graded.
  - Ensure that your code is in the master branch.  Code in other
    branches will not be graded.
  - Submit your code by the deadline.  Late work will not be graded.
  - Keep the same directory structure and function names as in the
    stater code.  The grading scripts will test your code based on the
    directory structure and function names in the starter code.  If
    you change either, your code will not pass the tests, and you will
    not receive credit.
  - Code that does not compile will not receive credit.
